# Activity 3.1

i think the feasible study would be to actually get the customer show a picture of something they would like to happen rather than waste every ones time trying to figure our how to design it, the requirement definition is so that you actually know what you need and get it in advance so you can make it on time, the software design team will be able to get everything updated so nothing crashes, configuration all depends on what the customer wants and is designed to their specific needs, final testing is where you can ask the customer to test the product just to make sure that they have exactly what they asked for before they pay for it, post implementation is whats needed to happen before the team can actually put it up for their own clients.
