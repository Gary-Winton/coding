Phone Number Validator:

I tried many ways to use regex for the Phone Number Validator, each 
one only marginally more successful than the last. I tried many 
things that I can no longer remember, but eventually realizing that 
I was getting nowhere, I decided to look at the hints that 
freeCodeCamp provides. When those only told me what I already knew, 
I took a look at the answers also provided by freeCodeCamp.
As soon as I saw the breakdown of the regex expression it made total
sense to me.
Thinking about it later I could have thought to search for a regex 
"library" that explained what expressions do what. 20/20 hindsight...


Cash Register:

I first started pair-coding this with Gary, but ended up finished it 
in a seperate file (indexCopy-Frank's) by myself, as Gary was not 
often available. In this file I started fresh so that I could apply 
what I had already learned while keeping my code cleaner.
Most of my difficulties came from trying to calculate how much of 
each type of change to return. My issue here was wrapping my head 
around how to apply the math that I needed and controlling the 
execution of the nested for loop.
