In this activity i named myFunc, I learned that with a simple code we are able to remove extra symbols like # if we choose to 
not have them at all, even though to me instead of removing them with the code, why not just type it plainly
and straight to the point, in this i used the x as a variable then .replace so that way i can change everything 
that i put into the parameters.

in myFunc2, i learned that an arr can be used as a variable and then it can be filtered with a ES6 => , 
then when use the let with a different variable that = true.when we use the for() that when we tell it to use 
something completely useful and direct to make our code work.

In myFunc3, we are trying to pull the variables that has digits connecting to it by using arr.filter, 
just like the code above as it i think it would work excactly the same.
