This lab is where we had a bunch of numbers in as array and we had to get them in a descending and ascending order so that people
can read it and that way we know and understand how to do it if ever asked to complete something like this again.
at the beginning of this task, i actually found it quite difficult but i got there in the end, by asking one of my class mates
help, which i believe he was happy to to.
