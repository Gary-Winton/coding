# SDV503-week-3

This is my 3rd Journal and we were asked to create a repository for week 3 with an index.js and to start typing in our journal, i had a bit of trouble cloning my repository but just to know that its case senstive so i need to keep that in mind for next time.

i learned the increments is either addingg the number straight away or lagged abit due to the code your useing, we were told to install quokka.js to help us as it adds everything onto the code itself aswel as in the terminal.

for quokka ctrl and k then q turns it on and ctrl and k then e turns it off, const locks in the # or name but let allows you to change the variable., increment is adding the number and decrement is subtracting the number. if alert doesnt work, use console.log as it works the same way.
i had trouble on line 31 but when an extra = was added it worked as its a console.log nof a if variable, now i understand why my quokka didnt work

x = 1 // variable for both other wise the IF statement wont work
y = 1
if (x == y & x  == 1) {
    console.log(x)  }
    1 = true and 0 = false
