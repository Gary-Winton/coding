This function is what i used to create a dateDiff as per instructions i have created a code where is tells me 
the amount of days between each date.
I used the .getTime method that allows me to subtract from a converted date and time, then used .math to convert 
time back in to the date format.
I then used the return to get the information needed for my console.logs(dateDiff)
