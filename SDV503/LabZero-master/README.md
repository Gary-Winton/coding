this is my first attept at my journal, i had a bit of trouble getting back in to git and git hub, but after a few trial and errors i managed to get there in the end, my major issue was learning the branch command lines as im not use to doing them, my fist time branching, i did it wrong and brached the checkout instead of commiting it and then the next time i learned that to merge the 2 branches you need to checkout first

My second part to this journal is that i had to create a new repository and have my classmates do their own branches as colaborators and then merge them back onto my master as part of a test to see what we knew and learned at the same time
