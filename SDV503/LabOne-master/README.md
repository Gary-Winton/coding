This is my second Journal and we are leraning to peer code, in was help Asti and i had trouble to just ler her do it without me just taking over, i figured out that const(does not let you change the code) but let (does), how do add, sub, sum, div, rem numbers in the same way as you variable the number or name then you change it in the console.log (num + num - num * num % num / num) and so one the you do the same with sum when i do (name + name + naem) it pulls the name together without spaces and when i do (name, name, name) it adds a space between the names, i learned that Const and const are completely different so it didnt work.when is did Const it was giving me a Syntex error as i had the capitol C and not a small 1.

I also learned that variable is the same as const, also that // is single line comment and /* is a multi line comment*/ ,
 I do not undestand the Global and Local, but im assuming that gobal is worldwide and local is centrally located.
