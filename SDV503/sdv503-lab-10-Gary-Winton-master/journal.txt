this is a task where a physical game is involved called paper, scissors, rock so had to write who wins in each 
scenario, used the const players and used p1 and p2 as the variables, gave each move to each player so the 
correct return can be given back in the console.log.

in myFunc, we were given a task to take any array of number and sort it in to order, no matter how many of that 
number you have, it will just use 1 of them just to make the numbers from lowest to highest, 
using the .from and .sort methods to make this happen and get the return required
