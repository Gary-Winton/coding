i learned that when you use the if statement then if you have something else that got the same description then you use the else 
if statement and when you use the switch statement then you use var with console.log and a break at the end to separate each 1
 use : after each case, if it doesn't match the first line then it will continue to go down each one until it matches up with
 the score that is needed to mark correctly.
